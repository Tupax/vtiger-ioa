you have a launch.json file for a vtiger crm 7.X with Xdebug installed: 2.8.1, ask me what extra information do you need from my phpinfo file

To configure Xdebug in your launch.json file for Vtiger CRM 7.X, you'll need the following information from your phpinfo() output:

    xdebug.remote_enable: This should be set to On to enable remote debugging with Xdebug.
    xdebug.remote_host: This should be set to the IP address or hostname of the machine where your IDE is running. If your IDE is running on the same machine as your web server, you can set this to localhost.
    xdebug.remote_port: This should be set to the port number that Xdebug will use to communicate with your IDE. By default, this is set to 9000.
    xdebug.remote_autostart: This should be set to On to enable Xdebug to automatically start a debugging session when a script is executed.

Once you have this information, you can use it to configure your launch.json file for Vtiger CRM 7.X.

how to set xdebug.remote_enable on?

To set xdebug.remote_enable to On, you need to make changes to your php.ini file or to an xdebug.ini file if it exists in your system.

To do so, follow the steps below:

    Open your php.ini or xdebug.ini file in a text editor.

    Search for the line that starts with xdebug.remote_enable. If the line is commented out (with a semicolon), remove the semicolon to uncomment the line.

    If the line is not present, add the following line to the end of the file:

    graphql

    xdebug.remote_enable = On

    Save the changes to the file.

After making these changes, restart your web server for the changes to take effect. You can then check the phpinfo() output to confirm that xdebug.remote_enable is set to On.

how to find php.ini inside a docker container?

To find the location of the php.ini file inside a Docker container, you can run the php --ini command inside the container. Here are the steps to do so:

    Start the Docker container:

    php

docker start <container_name>

Connect to the container's command line interface using docker exec:

python

docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash

Run the following command to find the location of the php.ini file:

css

php --ini

This will display the location of the php.ini file, along with any additional configuration files that are loaded.

For example, the output may look something like this:

javascript

    Configuration File (php.ini) Path: /usr/local/etc/php
    Loaded Configuration File:         /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini
    Scan for additional .ini files in: /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d
    Additional .ini files parsed:      /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-opcache.ini,
                                       /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini

    In this example, the php.ini file is located at /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini.

    Note: The exact location of the php.ini file may vary depending on the Docker image you are using.

how to restart the webserver

To restart the webserver running inside a Docker container, you can use the following command:

php

docker restart <container_name>

Replace <container_name> with the name or ID of your Docker container. This command will stop and start the container, which will in turn restart the webserver and load any changes you have made to the php.ini file or other configuration files.

After the container has restarted, you can check the phpinfo() output or run the php --ini command again to confirm that the changes you made have been applied.

can i do the same inside the cli interface using docker exec?

Yes, you can also restart the webserver inside the Docker container using docker exec command by running the appropriate command for your web server. Here are some examples:

For Apache:

python

docker exec <container_name> apachectl restart

For Nginx:

python

docker exec <container_name> service nginx restart

Replace <container_name> with the name or ID of your Docker container. These commands will restart the webserver and load any changes you have made to the php.ini file or other configuration files.

After the webserver has restarted, you can check the phpinfo() output or run the php --ini command again to confirm that the changes you made have been applied.

its a apache server, but i'm already in the bash inside the containter

If you are already in the bash shell inside the Docker container, you can restart the Apache web server using the following command:

service apache2 restart

This command will restart the Apache service and load any changes you have made to the php.ini file or other configuration files.

After the Apache service has restarted, you can check the phpinfo() output or run the php --ini command again to confirm that the changes you made have been applied.

xdebug Version 	2.8.1 doesn't accept xdebug.client.host ?

In Xdebug version 2.8.1, the xdebug.client_host configuration option has been deprecated and replaced by xdebug.client_host and xdebug.discover_client_host.

To configure Xdebug 2.8.1 to work with your IDE, you can set the following configuration options in your php.ini or xdebug.ini file:

javascript

xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.start_with_request=yes
xdebug.client_host=<IDE IP address>
xdebug.client_port=9003

Replace <IDE IP address> with the IP address of the machine where your IDE is running. You can set the xdebug.client_port to any available port number that you prefer.

After making these changes, restart your web server for the changes to take effect. Then, you can configure your IDE to listen for incoming Xdebug connections on the specified port number, and initiate a debugging session in your web application to start debugging with Xdebug.

how to know the IDE IP address?

To find the IP address of your IDE, you can use the following steps:

    Open your IDE and start a debugging session, if it's not already started.

    Check your IDE's configuration or settings to see if it shows the IP address it is listening on. For example, in PHPStorm, you can go to Preferences -> Languages & Frameworks -> PHP -> Debug and check the Debug port setting to see the IP address and port number.

    If your IDE does not show the IP address it is listening on, you can try the following commands to find the IP address of your machine:

    On Windows:

ipconfig

Look for the IP address next to "IPv4 Address" or "IPv6 Address" under the adapter that you are currently using to connect to the network.

On Linux/macOS:

    ifconfig

    Look for the IP address next to "inet" or "inet6" under the adapter that you are currently using to connect to the network.

    Note: If you are on a network with DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), the IP address of your machine may change over time. In that case, you will need to update the xdebug.client_host configuration option in your php.ini file accordingly.

its vscode my IDE.

To find the IP address of your machine that is running VS Code, you can try the following steps:

    Open a terminal or command prompt on your machine.

    Type the following command:

    On Windows:

ipconfig

On Linux/macOS:

    ifconfig

    Look for the IP address next to "IPv4 Address" or "inet" under the network adapter that you are currently using to connect to the network.

    Use this IP address as the value for xdebug.client_host in your php.ini file.

Alternatively, you can try using the special hostname host.docker.internal as the value for xdebug.client_host. This hostname should resolve to the IP address of the host machine that is running the Docker container.

For example, you can set the following configuration options in your php.ini or xdebug.ini file:

bash

xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.start_with_request=yes
xdebug.client_host=host.docker.internal
xdebug.client_port=9003

After making these changes, restart your web server for the changes to take effect. Then, you can configure VS Code to listen for incoming Xdebug connections on port 9003, and initiate a debugging session in your web application to start debugging with Xdebug.

how to update xdebug version inside a conteiner?

To update Xdebug to a newer version inside a Docker container, you can follow these general steps:

    Find out the current version of Xdebug installed in the container by running the php -v command.

    Download the newer version of Xdebug that you want to install. You can download the source code from the Xdebug website, or use a package manager like pecl or apt-get to install a pre-built binary.

    Install the new version of Xdebug. Depending on how you downloaded the new version, the installation process may differ. For example, if you downloaded the source code, you will need to compile and install it manually. If you are using a package manager, you can use the appropriate command to install the new version.

    Update the php.ini or xdebug.ini file to use the new version of Xdebug. You will need to change the path to the Xdebug extension to point to the new version. For example, if you downloaded and installed the new version of Xdebug at /usr/local/lib/php/extensions/xdebug.so, you can update the zend_extension directive in the php.ini file to:

    ruby

    zend_extension=/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/xdebug.so

    Restart the web server for the changes to take effect. You can do this using the service command, as mentioned earlier.

After following these steps, you should be able to use the new version of Xdebug in your Docker container. You can verify the version of Xdebug by running the php -v command again.
